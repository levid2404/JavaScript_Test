v1
Simple HTML5 based site, with a button outputting a text in a Alert box and in console using window.Alert() and console.log()
Looking to improve!
And i added a js background.
I changed the font, and added a shoutout to myself :)
I changed the JavaScript Code from Internal to External js file.
